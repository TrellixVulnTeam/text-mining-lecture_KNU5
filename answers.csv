Most products that Nestl√© produces in the poorer countries are in small plastic sachets which are priced accordingly. The next size up is a large container which most cannot afford.  I asked them for help in assisting some of the poorer families who were really suffering from the covid lockdown.

Nestl√© could for example have collection points for their used packaging and pay the people by weight on what was returned. That way, the packaging continues to have a value, People would collect it off the beaches and  streets and return to the collection points to earn a bit of money.
